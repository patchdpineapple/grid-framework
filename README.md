# Project: Design Your Own Grid-Based Framework

This is the final project of the HTML/CSS course from The Odin Project.\
The task is to create your own simple grid-based framework using Sass/Scss, then use the framework to clone a webpage of your choice.
The goal of the project is to be able to utilize a CSS preprocessor in order to create a framework and to easily style components.

#### How to use the framework
Copy and paste the main.css file onto a folder and import it onto your main stylesheet file linked to your html
User .container class to create your container. For columns or rows, utilize .all, .sm, .md, .lg, .xl classes as well
as .columns(check main.css for the values of the properties of these classes). CSS Reset was adapted from Eric Meyer's css reset.
